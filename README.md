# HLTV-DataScraper
In this repositorium, the HLTV scraper uses a Python-based parser to extract data from the web. The data is then cleaned in a Jupyter Notebook, stored in a relational database, and exported as a recovery file for SQL Server, allowing users to practice data analysis. the project is an alternative solution for the HLTV API, which has no public access
